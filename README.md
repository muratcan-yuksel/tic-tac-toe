<p>Before this project, my general approach to coding was to tuck everything away into a single function, generally an event listener. <br>
This proved to cause lots of headaches as whenever I needed to change something, I'd need to change almost everything with it. <br>
Thanks to the module pattern, I don't have to do it like that anymore. <br>
It's super cool actually, you just create different functions that can interact with each other organically.<br>
Apart form that, I learned how to implement an AI into the game. That was cool.</p>
